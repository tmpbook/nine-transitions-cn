# Stage 1: Bars 

## 阶段 1：K 线（Bar）

The first stage in mastering price action is to know what any kind of bar is.  
掌握价格行为的第一步是弄清每一种 K 线的含义。

This does not just mean differentiating between a reversal bar and an inside bar but also what the bar means in a given context.  
不仅要区分反转柱、内包柱，更要理解它们在特定上下文中的意义。

For example, you should master various aspects that strengthen and weaken a setup such as:  
例如，你必须掌握能强化或削弱信号的各种因素，例如：

- an up/down trend bar pair is a reversal signal only if it’s not in mid-range.
- 多头/空头趋势柱的组合，只有不处于区间中部时才算反转信号。
- A doji before a reversal bar greatly weakens the signal.  
- 反转柱前出现十字星，会明显削弱信号。
- An inside bar needs to have a strong close to be a reversal signal, but a tail may be acceptable if it’s a failed breakout of a Trading Range.  
- 内包柱若想成为反转信号需要强势收盘，但若是交易区间假突破则尾巴可以接受。
- doji signal bars often work for with-trend trades but fail for counter-trend trades.  
- 十字星作为信号柱常在顺势交易有效，但逆势交易常失败。
- huge bars are trading ranges.  
- 超大柱通常表示交易区间（TTR）。


## 阶段 2：K 线序列（Bar Sequences）

Master bar sequences. Most setups are bar sequences so you should be able to recognize them.  
掌握 K 线序列。大多数信号都是由序列构成，因此你必须能够识别它们。

For example:  
例如：

- 2 legged pullbacks  
- 双腿回调（2L / A2 等）
- three pushes with TCL OS  
- 三次推动 + 趋势通道线超越（楔形结构）
- trend channel overshoots of MTL  
- 主趋势线（MTL）被通道超越（Overshoot）

In addition, you should be able to expect common bar patterns based on current bar.  
此外，你必须根据当下的柱子预期可能形成的序列。

For example:  
例如：

- large bar could become possible Spike and Channel  
- 大柱可能发展成“冲刺 + 通道”（Spike & Channel）
- large bar could be a failed breakout  
- 大柱也可能是突破失败
- a pullback bar followed by doji could become barb wire  
- 回调柱后跟十字星可能发展为“铁丝网”（BW）
- bars suddenly turn tiny and doji-like in a strong trend could be TTR  
- 强趋势中突然变细小且像十字星，可能是窄幅横盘（TTR）


## 阶段 3：市场结构（Market Structure）

Market structure takes a bit more experience, but this is the most important.  
市场结构需要更多经验，但它最关键。

You should be able to keep track of whether the market is trending, is about to break out into a trend from a trading range, etc.  
你必须能判断市场是在趋势、即将从区间进入趋势，或处于其他结构中。

You should also determine the kind of move and the type of trading that’s successful in this market.  
你必须能判断当前结构下什么类型的交易最有效。

Is it a soft trend where you should buy every fL2?  
这是软趋势，需要逢 fL2 做多？

Is it a hard trend and you should short every L1?  
这是硬趋势，需要逢 L1 做空？

Is the range very tight and every trade is a scalp since every stop will be taken out?  
是非常紧的区间，每个交易都是短线，因为所有止损都会被扫？

Is it a strongly trending market that is likely to run for a long time?  
是强趋势，有可能持续很久？

Is it a wild and crazy market that's stopping everyone in all directions?  
还是剧烈混乱的市场，来回扫止损？

The quicker you can recognize these, the faster you can act.  
越快识别，越能及时行动。

Market structure is your filter and guide ensuring you don’t take trades in the wrong direction.  
市场结构是你的过滤器，确保你不会站错方向。

If you like to swing for multiple points, you want to trade with-trend in a strongly trending market.  
若你想做几点以上的波段，必须在强趋势中顺势交易。

If the market is weak or tight, you can trade both with and counter-trend (with experience).  
若市场弱或窄，你可以顺逆势都做（需要经验）。

Market structure mastery also allows you to sit through pullbacks and exit at the right time.  
掌握结构能让你承受回调并在正确时间离场。

Until you have mastered this, you will feel helpless in anything but normal average trends and ranges.  
在掌握结构前，你在正常趋势外的行情中会感到无力。

You will sit helplessly in a hard trend and short your way to the top in a soft trend.  
你会在硬趋势中不停抄底，在软趋势中一路做空到顶部。

However, even with market structure mastery, you won't be able to enter correctly without mastering Stages 1 and 2.  
然而，即使掌握市场结构，只要没掌握阶段 1 和 2，你仍然无法正确入场。

If your entries are stopped out and the market then moves in your original direction, you have poor mastery of stage 2.  
如果你被止损扫掉后市场又按你原方向走，你对阶段 2（序列）的掌握不足。

---

Stage 1 is so fundamental that you need to be a really poor trader to not master this.  
阶段 1 基础到只要你不是极其差的交易者就能掌握。

If you are buying above bear bars and selling below bull bars and many entries become 1tf or 5tf, you probably need to work on mastering your bars properly.  
如果你经常在空头柱上方买、多头柱下方卖，并且很多交易变成 1tf 或 5tf，你需要重新学习柱子的基础。

---

During trading hours, mark the chart with your read of the Stages above and compare your performance at the end of the day.  
交易时，把你对上述三个阶段的判断标在图上，收盘后对照表现。

This will help identify areas that need work and you should pick one or two deficiencies and fix them one by one.  
这能让你找出需要改进的部分，逐个修正，每次只修一个或两个。

Most people are unable to fix all problems at once, so don't bother trying it.  
多数人无法一次修复所有问题，不必尝试。

---

Using the 10-week rule, if you have correctly identified items you seek to correct on the chart, you can move on to the next one.  
按“10 周规则”，如果你已能在图上稳定识别并纠正一个问题，就可以继续下一个。
